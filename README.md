## Description

This Social Networking application allows users to share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This API was built using MongoDB to create a database, Express.js for routing and the Mongoose Object Data Modeling (ODM) library. Insomnia was used to demonstrate it functionality.
